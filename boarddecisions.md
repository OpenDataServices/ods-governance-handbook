# Board Decisions

The board of directors is responsible for making decisions which have not been [delegated](delegation), and for delegating responsibility as necessary.

Our board is made up of all of our co-op [members](membership).

## Matters for the Board

## Decision Pipeline

The decision pipeline provides an overview of all upcoming and ongoing board decisions. We review this every other week, at [members meetings](directorsmeetings#members-meetings). 

[Documentation for the decision pipeline can be read here](https://decision-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Ad-hoc Board Decisions

Sudden, urgent decisions to be made.

Decisions from a delegated domain that were unable to be resolved, and so have been escalated to the board.

Decisions about something which has not been delegated, but should be.

Board can decide to:

* Make a particular resolution on the issue itself.
* Delegate the decision to an existing subgroup.
* Postpone the decision to a future meeting (entails putting it on the decision pipeline, and doing any other appropriate prepatory work).
