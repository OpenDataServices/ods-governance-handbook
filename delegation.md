# Delegation

Responsibility for decision-making in certain domains can be delegated by [the board](boarddecisions). When responsibilities are delegated on a permanent basis, this is to a _subgroup_. When responsibilities are delegated on a time-limited basis, this is to a _working group_. This happens as follows:

1. Members identify a domain of the business where:
  * the needs of the business are best served by the focussed attention of a small number; or
  * responsibilities are not being adequately or consistently met; or
  * the board does not have sufficient expertise.
2. Two to four people convene to draw up a [terms of reference](#terms-of-reference) to describe and constrain the domain, aims and responsibilities of a new subgroup; or a [mandate](#mandates) setting out a specific task and timeline for a new working group. They should seek input from members and staff with the relevant interest and expertise as needed.
3. Initial members of the emerging subgroup or working group are nominated.
4. A new [terms of reference](#terms-of-reference) should be agreed by directors at an [OGM](directorsmeetings#ordinary-general-meeting). A [mandate](#mandate) may be agreed at an [OGM](directorsmeetings#ordinary-general-meeting) or a [members meeting](directorsmeetings#members-meeting).
