# Decisions

We make decisions collectively, first and foremost by [consent](#consent).

In short, the decision process begins when a [proposal](proposals) is put forward at the appropriate [venue](directorsmeetings), and ends when either there are no substantive objections to the proposal, or there are objections such that the proposal cannot proceed.

A [summary diagram of the decision-making process is in progress here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMHCv0OU=/).

## Consent

We aim to strike a balance between hearing everyone's views on a proposal, and making decisions within a reasonable time frame. The consent process helps us to ensure everyone gets a chance to voice their opinions or concerns. Hearing from others can help us to clarify and improve proposals, and results in stronger buy-in which is important when it comes actually following through the outcome of a proposal.

If someone has concerns, but does not wish to block a proposal, they can formally _consent with reservations_, and their concerns will be recorded and revisited when it is time to review the outcome of the proposal.

If an [objection](#objections) stands after the proposors have tried to resolve it, a decision can go to a [majority vote](#majority-voting).
