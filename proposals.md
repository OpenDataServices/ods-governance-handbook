# Proposals

Decisions are made around a proposal. Any [member](membership) can put a proposal to the board, but typically these are collaborative efforts, and should be made at the appropriate [venue](directorsmeetings).

If a member has a proposal idea or an issue that needs to be resolved, they should first find out if it falls within a domain of work that has been [delegated](delegation). If so, they should raise it with the appropriate [subgroup](delegation#subgroups) or [working group](delegation#working-groups).
