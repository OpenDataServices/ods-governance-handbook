# Directors Meetings

Directors meetings are any quorate meetings at which [board-level decisions](boarddecisions) can be made.

Non-members are not expected to attend, but are welcome as observers.

## Members Meetings

We hold short (up to 2 hours) members meetings approximately every two weeks. We use this time to monitor delegated activities, and to prepare for upcoming [board decisions](boarddecisions).

The agenda should provide an opportunity to:

* Review the [decision pipeline](boarddecisions#decision-pipeline) for awareness of upcoming and in-progress decisions.
* Hear updates from or provide input to [subgroups](delegation#subgroups) on delegated activity as needed.
* Hear updates on strategic matters, as needed.
* Hear updates on financial information, as needed.
* Ask questions on upcoming or in-progress decisions.
* Hold exploratory discussions on upcoming or in-progress decisions.
* Make [ad-hoc board decisions](boarddecisions#ad-hoc-board-decisions).
